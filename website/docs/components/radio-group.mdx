> A radio group allows the user to select one item from a list of related items.

## Anatomy

1. **Label**: a short description or prompt that conveys how the radio options are related.
1. **Current selection**: the currently selected option.
1. **Options**: the available options. Clicking or arrowing to an unselected option will deselect the currently selected option.

## Usage

- Use radio buttons to allow a user to select exactly one item from a set of options, and display all available options.
- Radio buttons should have between 2-5 options.
    - If you have more than 5 options, use a [dropdown](dropdown) or combo box.
- The options in a group of radio buttons must be mutually exclusive. The user can only select 1 Radio.
- Only use radio buttons when the field is required. If all radio buttons are in an unselected state on load, a user must select one of the radio buttons before proceeding.
- Arrow keys move focus within the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> selects the focused radio button if it is not already selected.

:::tip Dos
- Do allow users to select a Radio by clicking the radio button or its text label.
- Do position the radio button to the left of its label.
- Do display options in a vertical layout, by default, for easier scanning.
- Consider the most logical order to display options, such as alphabetical, chronological or by popularity.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use radio buttons if a user could select multiple options. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don't use radio buttons if a user could select NO Radio. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use radio buttons if an action will take immediate effect when the user selects or deselects it.
    - Use a [switch](switch) if there are two opposite options (example: YES/NO, ON/OFF).
    - Otherwise, use a group of regular [buttons](button).
