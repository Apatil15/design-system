> Radio buttons allow a user to select one Radio from a list.

## Anatomy

A group of radio buttons includes:

1. A Group Label
2. Two or more Radio Button Controls and their Labels

## Examples

```jsx live
<RadioGroup label="Select your native fruit">
	<Radio>Apple</Radio>
	<Radio>Cherry</Radio>
	<Radio>Orange</Radio>
	<Radio>Peach</Radio>
	<Radio>Pear</Radio>
</RadioGroup>
```

## Usage

- Use radio buttons to allow a user to select exactly one Radio from a set of options, and display all available options.
- Radio buttons should have between 2-5 options.
    - If you have more than 5 options, use a [dropdown](dropdown) or [combo box](combo-box).
- The options in a group of radio buttons must be mutually exclusive. The user can only select 1 Radio.
- Only use radio buttons when the field is required. If all radio buttons are in an unselected state on load, a user must select one of the radio buttons before proceeding.
- Arrow keys move focus within the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> selects the focused radio button if it is not already selected.

:::tip Dos
- Do allow users to select an Radio by clicking the radio button or its text label.
- Do position the radio button to the left of its label.
- Do display options in a vertical layout, by default, for easier scanning.
- Consider the most logical order to display options, such as alphabetical, chronological or by popularity.

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use radio buttons if a user could select multiple options. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don't use radio buttons if a user could select NO Radio. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use radio buttons if an action will take immediate effect when the user selects or deselects it.
    - Use a [switch](switch) if there are two opposite options (example: YES/NO, ON/OFF).
    - Otherwise, use a group of regular [buttons](button).
