> A checkbox allows the user to check or uncheck an option.

## Anatomy

A single checkbox includes:

1. **Control** - the input control that conveys the current state of the checkbox to the user.
1. **Label** - a short name that lets the user know what the checkbox is checking.
1. **Description** (_optional_) - additional text that can be used to add clarity or context to the checkbox label.

## Usage

- A single checkbox has two mutually exclusive states: selected or not selected.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> changes the state of the checkbox.
- Use a group of checkboxes to allow a user to select zero, one or multiple options from a list, and display all available options.
- Checkboxes may allow users to sub-select options from a nested list (see tri-state checkboxes).
- Checkboxes work independently of other checkboxes, unless they are controlled by a tri-state checkbox.

:::tip Dos
- Do allow users to select an option by clicking the checkbox or its label.
- Do position the checkbox to the left of its label.
- Do separate groups of checkboxes with group labels.
- Do display options in a vertical layout for easier scanning.
- Do define a label for the checkbox, even if it is not visible (example: when selecting a row in a table).
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use checkboxes if only one item can be selected from a list. Use radio buttons or a dropdown instead.
- Don’t use a checkbox if an action will take immediate effect when the user selects or deselects it. Add a Submit button to confirm, or use a toggle instead.
- Don’t use negative statements for a checkbox, because taking action to select it is confusing and counter-intuitive. (example: “I don’t want to receive email…”)
:::

- Avoid setting default options, because pre-selecting an option makes it more likely that users will not make a conscious choice and submit an option unintentionally.
- Consider the most logical order to list options. Options may be listed alphabetically, by popularity, or some other ordered system that should be clear to the user.

## Types

### Dual-state Checkbox

- A single checkbox is a dual-state checkbox.
- A dual-state checkbox allows a user to switch between two states: checked and not checked.

### Tri-state Checkbox

- A tri-state checkbox supports three states: checked, not checked, and indeterminate (partially checked).
- A tri-state checkbox is used to represent and control the state of a group of options. Each option in the group can also be individually checked or unchecked with a dual state checkbox.
    - If all options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as checked.
    - If some of the options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as indeterminate (partially checked).
    - If none of the options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as not checked.
    - If a user checks a tri-state checkbox, then all the options in the group are checked.
    - If a user unchecks a tri-state checkbox, then all the options in the group are unchecked.
