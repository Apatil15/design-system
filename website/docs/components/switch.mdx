> A switch allows a user to immediately turn an option on or off.

## Anatomy

![A diagram of the switch's various pieces, defined below.](/img/anatomy_switch.png)

1. Label
2. Description `optional`
3. Control

## Examples

```jsx live
<Switch label="Switch" />
```

## Usage

- When a user toggles a switch, its corresponding action takes effect right away.
- A switch has two mutually exclusive states&mdash;on and off.

:::tip Dos
- Do use a switch to mimic a physical on/off switch in the interface.
- Do allow users to select the switch by clicking the control or its text label.
- Do position the switch to the left of its text label by default.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use the words “on/off” in the switch’s text label. The option that the switch controls should be clear from its label. A tooltip/title attribute may be added to convey the on/off state.
- Don’t use a switch if the option is part of a larger flow, with a final confirmation step or Submit button. Use a [checkbox](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use a switch if users can select multiple options from a list. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
