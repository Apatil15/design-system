> A button allows a user to perform an action.

## Anatomy

1. The label
2. `Optional` An icon

## Playground

```tsx live
<Button variant="solid">Solid</Button>
```

```tsx live
<IconButton icon="info">More information</IconButton>
```

## Usage

- A button is a standalone call-to-action with space or visual emphasis around it.
- A button has a meaningful label that communicates the action that users can take.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> (keyup) and <kbd>Enter</kbd> (keydown) activates the button.

:::tip Dos
- Do indicate the most important action on a page or region with a high-emphasis Primary button.
- Do indicate less important actions with medium-emphasis Secondary buttons or low-emphasis Tertiary buttons.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don't wrap text inside a button.
- Don't use labels that are too long. A button's label should be very concise.
- Don't choose default button colors that could be confused with disabled buttons.
- Don't create links that look like buttons. If dictation software users say "show buttons", the actions will not be listed. Keyboard users may try to press Space to activate, which will do nothing.

### Buttons vs. links

Links are similar to buttons but the two are not interchangeable.
The following should help differentiate when a link may be a better fit for your control.

:::note Consider using links if...
- You are navigating to another place, either on the same page or on a different page.
- The action will change the URL.
- It would be useful to "Copy", "Open in a new tab", or "Bookmark" the destination URL.
- The label is embedded in a sentence, and does not need margins or padding.
- The label conveys location, not an action (for example: a link that references a resource).
- Only <kbd>Enter</kbd> (keydown) should activate the link. Links always move focus when activated.
:::

- Use a button if the component is styled like a button. (See _Don't create links that look like buttons_, above).
- If a button navigates the user to a new page or section, it might not meet the user's expectations.
- A button will not record the navigation in the user's browser history, so they will not be able to return to the previous location using their browser's back button.
- Consider the overall navigation of the site. Links help define the structure, architecture and hierarchy of the site&mdash;buttons don't.
