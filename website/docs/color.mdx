The Norton color system ensures that colors can be used in a predictable way
across your application and content.

:::note Terms
A color **family** is a collection of colors of the same hue.
Individual colors within the family have different brightness and/or saturation.
A color family is referred to by its generic hue name, such as `red`, `teal`, or
`gray`.
By default, every color family contains `10` total **grades**.

A color **grade** is numbered a step corresponding to the brightness of that color.
A higher number corresponds to a darker color and a lower number corresponds to
a lighter color.
By default, grades start at `10` and increase by increments of `10` up to `100`.

## Design Tokens

The Norton color system uses two types of design tokens for color:

- **System** tokens, which have static (unchangeable) values for their grades.
  - These follow a naming pattern of `nds-{family}-{grade}`, such as `nds-cyan-30`.
- **Role** tokens, which have customizable values for their grades.
  - These follow a naming pattern of `nds-{role}-color-{grade}`, such as `nds-primary-color-60`.

### System Tokens

The following chart contains every system color in the Norton color system.
Token names (`teal-60`), values (`#1a8082`), and the maximum level of WCAG
conformance against black and white are listed on the color swatch.

### Role Tokens

All color roles reference either a single system color or a family of colors.

| Token                        | Usage                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `background-color`           | The main background color                                     |
| `text-color`                 | The main text color                                           |
| `text-color-inverse`         | A contrasting text color                                      |
| `subdued-color`              | De-emphasized, muted, or subdued content                      |
| `selection-background-color` | The background color of user-selected text (`::selection`)    |
| `selection-text-color`       | The text color of user-selected text (`::selection`)          |
| `focus-color`                | The color used when an element has been focused (`:focus`)    |
| `focus-halo-inner-color`     | The inner color of the [focus halo](accessibility#focus-halo) |
| `focus-halo-outer-color`     | The outer color of the [focus halo](accessibility#focus-halo) |
| `primary-color`\*            | The main application color                                    |
| `base-color`\*               | Background, border, or shadow gradients                       |
| `disabled-color`\*           | Not currently usable, non-interactive                         |
| `error-color`\*              | Error, danger, or incorrect                                   |
| `success-color`\*            | Success, passing, or correct                                  |
| `warning-color`\*            | Warning or caution                                            |

\* These color tokens are part of an entire **color family** and should be customized on build by specifying a custom `${role}-family` and `${role}-grade`.
For instance, setting `$primary-family: 'blue'` and `$primary-grade: 70` would result in `primary-color` equaling `blue-70`.

In Sass, this can easily be done on use:

```scss
@use '@wwnds/core' with (
	$primary-family: 'blue',
	$primary-grade: 70,
	$base-color: 'gray',
);
```

### Color Schemes

Customizing the color system's [role tokens](design-tokens#role-tokens) is one of the easiest ways to begin theming an application.
We ships with a light color scheme and a dark color scheme, both of set default values for these tokens.
See [the full color tokens stylesheet](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/blob/main/packages/core/src/color/tokens.scss) for more on how this is done.

## Accessibility

The Norton color system is built to ensure consistent color contrast across all
color families.
To accomplish this, grades are normalized across color families to have a similar
level of color contrast against black or white.
Grades of `60` and higher will always meet [the minimum color contrast ratio for WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum)
when used with pure white (`#fff`).
Conversely, grades of `50` and lower will always meet WCAG AA requirements against
pure black (`#000`).
