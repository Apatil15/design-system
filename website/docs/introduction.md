The Norton Design System takes a content-focused, born accessible approach to
modern web applications.
It is used at W. W. Norton & Company to build tools for learning as well as the
books and content that our customers love.

## Tools

The design system combines equal parts [design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking)
and [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) to create
tools and frameworks to help you build web applications and content.
These tools include:

- A predefined set of shared design properties captured as technology-agnostic
  [design tokens](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group#design-tokens).
- A modern <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> framework that contains
  an implementation of the design tokens, component styling, and utilities to help
  you build your application.
- A [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library that is [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)
  to the CSS framework.
