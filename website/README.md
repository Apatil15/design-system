# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Development

The development task, like all tasks, should be run from the root of the repository, not here.

```sh
npm run dev:docs
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
