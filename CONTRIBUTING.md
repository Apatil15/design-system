# Contributing

Anyone who would like to contribute is welcome and encouraged to help in any way shape or form.
To contribute code, edits, or any other type of modification, make changes in a separate branch and create a merge request to allow maintainers to review your changes.

Read the [branching strategy wiki page](wikis/Branching-Strategy) for more details on branches and merge requests.

Issues labelled [good first issue](https://gitlab.com/wwnorton/platform/design-system/issues?label_name[]=good+first+issue) are a great place to start if you'd like to contribute but aren't sure how.
To get started, write a message in that issue to let the maintainers know you'd like to tackle it and they will help you through the process.

## Commit Standards

Commits should generally follow [git best practices](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/).
Specifically, contributors MUST strive to follow these two conventions:

- [commit early and often](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#commit)
- [make useful commit messages](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#usemsg)

### Message conformance

Release notes are automatically generated by [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) using metadata created by YOU in your commit messages.
To accomplish this, commit messages MUST include a valid commit type and SHOULD provide a message that will be comprehensible in the changelog.

This is enforced by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard.
On commit, [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will run commitlint to validate your commit messages.
Commit messages that do not conform will fail.

For instance:

```sh
# fails commitlint check
git commit -m "update commitlint"
# husky runs commitlint and other checks and throws the following two errors:
‚úñ   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
‚úñ   type may not be empty [type-empty]

# passes all checks
git commit -m "chore(deps): update commitlint"
```

**TIP**: if you're unfamiliar with the commit types, try [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), a commitlint-aware tool that provides an interactive commandline interface that allows you to select your type.
Call it without having to install it globally with [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx):

```sh
npx git-cz
? Select the type of change that youre committing: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ üíç  test:       Adding missing tests
  üé∏  feat:       A new feature
  üêõ  fix:        A bug fix
  ü§ñ  chore:      Build process or auxiliary tool changes
  ‚úèÔ∏è  docs:       Documentation only changes
  üí°  refactor:   A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
  üíÑ  style:      Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
```

## Code Conformance

All code must conform to code quality standards before being accepted.
To make this easier, it is highly recommend that developers use the included Node.js tooling.

```sh
# install development dependencies locally
npm install
```

Once installed, the following commands will lint your code.

```sh
# lint javascript
npm run lint:es

# lint css
npm run lint:style

# run prettier without fixing anything
npm run lint:prettier
```

### Auto-fixing

Some issues can be fixed automatically by the provided tools.
Each tool's npm script comes with an accompanying `-fix` mode (e.g., `npm run lint:es-fix` will fix eslint errors).
Additionally, all linters can be run in fix mode concurrently:

```sh
npm run fix
```

Additionally, [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will auto-fix any staged files.
Read their documentation to learn more about how this happens.

### Rule overrrides

Both eslint and stylelint rules can be [overridden](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html#using-configuration-comments) or [disabled](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration/#turning-rules-off-from-within-your-css) via code comments.
This should only ever be done as a very last resort.
When used, all instances MUST conform to the following requirements:

- The override MUST include accompanying rationale in a preceding comment
- The override SHOULD be scoped to the specific line via `/* {eslint,stylelint}-disable-next-line <rule_name> */` or `// {eslint,stylelint}-disable-line <rule_name>` directives
  - If a block needs to be ignored, it MUST be re-enabled after the end of the block via `/* {eslint,stylelint}-enable <rule_name> */`
- The override MUST disable only the specific rule (i.e., no `/* {eslint,stylelint}-disable */` without a rule name)

#### Examples of acceptible overrides

A third-party library provides a required method that has a leading underscore, so the [no-underscore-dangle rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-underscore-dangle#disallow-dangling-underscores-in-identifiers-no-underscore-dangle) is disabled via the only on the line where it occurs:

Disable a single line with a reasonable explanation of why it's disabled:

```javascript
function foo(arg) {
  /* the _foo method is defined by <third_party_library_name> */
  /* eslint-disable-next-line no-underscore-dangle */
  return MyLib._foo(arg);
}
```

Disable a block and then re-enable it after, with a reasonable explanation of why it was disabled:

```javascript
function foo(arg) {
  if (someCondition) {
    /* <third_party_library_name> does not provide a method for reassignment */
    /* eslint-disable no-param-reassign */
    arg.foo = "bar";
    arg.bar = "baz";
    /* eslint-enable no-param-reassign */
  }
  return arg;
}
```

#### Examples of inacceptible overrides

Overriding the [no-underscore-dangle rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-underscore-dangle#disallow-dangling-underscores-in-identifiers-no-underscore-dangle) at the document level because a third-party library provides a method with a leading underscore:

```javascript
/* DON'T: DISABLE RULES AT THE DOCUMENT LEVEL */
/* eslint-disable no-underscore-dangle */
function foo(arg) {
  arg._foo("bar");
}
```

Some rules should never be disabled.
For instance, there is never a good reason to use the `var` keyword since `const` and `let` are [supported in all major browsers](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-const):

```javascript
/* DON'T: DISABLE RULES THAT ENCOURAGE BEST PRACTICES */
/* eslint-disable-next-line no-var */
var foo = "bar";

/* DO: SIMPLY USE THE CORRECT SYNTAX */
const foo = "bar";
```
