# Typescript Style

> A guide for writing clean and pleasing Typescript. Much of the [Javascript Style Guide](/guides/javascript-style) can be applied for Typescript as well.

Inspired by the recommended config in [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin)

## Recommended Rules

The full rules list can be found in the eslint-plugin [docs](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin#supported-rules)

- Require that member overloads be consecutive

- Disallows awaiting a value that is not a Thenable

- Bans `// @ts-<directive>` comments from being used or requires descriptions after directive

- Bans specific types from being used

- Require explicit return and argument types on exported functions' and classes' public class methods

- Disallow the declaration of empty interfaces

- Disallow usage of the `any` type

- Disallow extra non-null assertion

- Requires Promise-like values to be handled appropriately

- Disallow iterating over an array with a for-in loop

- Disallow the use of `eval()`-like methods

- Disallows explicit type declarations for variables or parameters initialized to a number, string, or boolean

- Enforce valid definition of `new` and `constructor`

- Avoid using promises in places not designed to handle them

- Disallow the use of custom TypeScript modules and namespaces

- Disallows using a non-null assertion after an optional chain expression

- Disallows non-null assertions using the `!` postfix operator

- Disallow aliasing `this`

- Disallows calling an any type value

- Disallows member access on any typed variables

- Disallows returning any from a function

- Disallows the use of require statements except in import statements

- Prefer usage of `as const` over literal type

- Require the use of the `namespace` keyword instead of the `module` keyword to declare custom TypeScript modules

- Enforce that `RegExp#exec` is used instead of `String#matc`h if no global flag is provided

- When adding two variables, operands must both be of type number or of type string

- Enforce template literal expressions to be of string type

- Sets preference level for triple slash directives versus ES6-style import declarations

- Enforces unbound methods are called with their expected scope
