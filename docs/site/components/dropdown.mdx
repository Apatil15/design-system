# Dropdown

> A dropdown allows a user to select one option from a list, and collapse the other options.

## Anatomy

A dropdown includes:

1. A Text Label
2. A Selected Option Area + Icon
3. A List of Options
4. Default Text (`"Select"`)

<!--
## Examples

<Playground>
	<Dropdown
		label="Choose a sitcom"
		options={[
			'Arrested Development',
			'Community',
			'Friends',
			'How I Met Your Mother',
			'Modern Family',
			'Parks and Recreation',
			'The Big Bang Theory',
			'The Office',
		]}
	/>
</Playground>
-->

## Usage

- Use a dropdown to select one option from a collapsed set of available options.
- By default, dropdown options are mutually exclusive. The user can only select 1 option.
- When an option is selected, the dropdown closes and the selected option updates to display that item.
- On load, the dropdown should display default text of `"Select"`. The user should be able to change it back to `"Select"` if they wish.
- `Accessibility` <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>/<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the next/previous options, respectively. Selection may also move with focus. <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the first/last options, respectively.

- Do keep dropdown options very concise.
    - If long options are unavoidable, then they can truncate when the dropdown is in a closed state, but they should wrap fully in the open state.
- Do ensure that the clickable area includes the entire selected option area and the icon.
- Consider the most logical order to list options. Options could be listed alphabetically, chronologically, by popularity, etc.

- Do not start all of the options in a dropdown with the same word or phrase.
- If there are more than 6 options, consider using a [combo box](combo-box) instead.
- If there are 2 options, consider using [radio buttons](radio-buttons) or [switch](switch) instead.
    - If your interface needs to contain many of these selections, use dropdowns over radio buttons.
- Do not use a dropdown when the user can multi-select options. Use checkboxes instead.
- If it is not absolutely necessary for a user to choose from a predefined set of options, then consider a [text field](text-field) for users to type their own information.
