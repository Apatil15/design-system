# Disclosure

> A disclosure allows the user to show and hide additional content.

## Anatomy

A disclosure includes:

An expandable button with

1. A text label
2. An icon
3. Content

## Examples

<Playground>
	<Disclosure variant="" summary="Default disclosure">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
	</Disclosure>
</Playground>

## Usage

- A disclosure has two states: collapsed and expanded. A disclosure is collapsed by default.
- A disclosure should include an icon that conveys that it can be activated for more information.
- A disclosure’s label should clearly and succinctly describe its hidden content, so that the user can choose to expand it.
- `Accessibility` When a disclosure has focus, <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> activate the disclosure and toggle the visibility of content.
- `Accessibility` All focusable elements inside a disclosure are included in the tab order, if the disclosure is expanded.

- Do use a disclosure to make the page easier to scan, and hide lower-priority information that only some users will need.
- Do ensure that the entire expandable button (label and icon) is clickable.
- Do display the expanded content directly after the expandable button.

- Don’t use a disclosure if most or all users need to see the content. When content is hidden, users may ignore that information.
- Don’t display a disabled disclosure if there is no content to reveal. Instead, do not display the disclosure at all, or include a message explaining why there is no content when the user activates it.
- Don’t use an icon that has multiple meanings within the same system.

- If there is only one section of content, then use a disclosure.
- If there are multiple sections of content, then use an accordion or tabs.
